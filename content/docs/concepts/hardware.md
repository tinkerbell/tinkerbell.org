The Hardware spec describes a physical machine. Its main purpose is for IP Address Management. Its current version is `v1alpha`. The v1alpha1 spec includes fields for specifying disk devices, cloudinit user data, and a few others. At installation time, it is deployed as a Kubernetes custom resource definition, `hardware.tinkerbell.org`. There are no required fields, but generally speaking and at a minimum you'll want IPAM data. This is specified at `spec.interfaces`. More info on the specific areas of the spec can be found in the following docs:

- Cloudinit - [here](/docs/integrations/cloudinit) and [here](/docs/services/tootles)
- DHCP and IPAM - [here](/docs/services/smee)
- Template Rendering - [here](/docs/services/tink-controller)

- The current v1alpha1 specs can be found here:
  - [Go spec]({{< repo_tree "api/v1alpha1/tinkerbell/hardware.go" >}})
  - [Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition]({{< repo_tree "crd/bases/tinkerbell.org_hardware.yaml" >}})
  - [Explorable Spec](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/tinkerbell/tinkerbell/tinkerbell.org/Hardware/v1alpha1@{{< tinkerbell_version >}})

- Which services use the spec?
    Smee - Uses the IPAM fields for serving DHCP and gating of whether a machine should be given network boot info or not.
    Tink Controller - Uses the spec for template rendering of workflows.
    Tootles - Uses the spec for serving metadata.
