title: 'Cluster API Provider Tinkerbell'
draft: false
geekdocDescription: "The Cluster API infrastructure provider implementation for Tinkerbell."
---

## Overview

[Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) (CAPI) brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to Kubernetes cluster creation, configuration and management.
The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true hybrid deployments of Kubernetes, both on-premises and off.
Tinkerbell has a Cluster API [Infrastructure provider](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/concepts#infrastructure-provider) that allows you to use Tinkerbell as a bare metal provider for CAPI.

This documentation is still being worked on. For the time being, please head
to the [Tinkerbell CAPI repository](https://github.com/tinkerbell/cluster-api-provider-tinkerbell).
