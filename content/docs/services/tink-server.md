## Overview

Tink Server exposes workflow actions over a gRPC API for [Tink Worker] to retrieve and execute. When a [Tink Worker] completes an action, it reports the status to Tink Server.
Tink Server uses Kubernetes custom resources to store workflow state.
Tink Server retrieves tasks from and updates task status' on [`Workflow`][workflow] Kubernetes custom resources. Tinkerbell users submit the [`Workflow`][workflow]s to the cluster via the Kube API Server.
