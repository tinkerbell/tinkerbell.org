Tinkerbell has four major components: a DHCP server (boots), a workflow engine (tink), an in-memory operating system (OSIE) and a metadata service (hegel). The workflow engine is comprised of a server and a CLI, which communicate over gRPC. The CLI is used to create a workflow along with its building blocks, templates and targets.
