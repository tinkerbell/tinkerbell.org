### Pushing hardware data

 - Exec into the tink CLI container using `docker exec -ti deploy_tink-cli_1 /bin/sh`:
 - Create a file containing the hardware data (say data.json)
   - ensure that you replace _<worker_mac_addr>_ with the actual worker MAC.
   - the worker MAC can be found in the Terraform output (and also in the generated _terraform.tfstate_ file).
   - if you did not use Terraform to provision the servers, you can call the Packet API _devices_ endpoint, and the worker MAC will be the MAC under _eth0_.
```
https://api.packet.net/devices/{device_id}
...
          "type": "NetworkPort",
          "name": "eth0",
          "data": {
              "bonded": false,
              "mac": "00:00:00:00:00:00" // worker mac
          },
...
```
 - Here is the minimal hardware data that can get you started with the [Hello World!](/examples/hello-world) example.
```
{
  "id": "ce2e62ed-826f-4485-a39f-a82bb74338e2",
  "arch": "x86_64",
  "allow_pxe": true,
  "allow_workflow": true,
  "facility_code": "onprem",
  "ip_addresses": [
    {
      "address": "192.168.1.5",
      "address_family": 4,
      "enabled": true,
      "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
      "management": true,
      "netmask": "255.255.255.248",
      "public": false
    }
  ],
  "network_ports": [
    {
      "data": {
        "mac": "ec:0d:9a:bf:ff:dc"
      },
      "name": "eth0",
      "type": "data"
    }
  ]
}
```
 - You can read more about the hardware data under [here](/hardware-data).

{{% notice note %}}
You will also have to adjust the `address` and `gateway` under `ip_addresses` accordingly if you chose a non-default subnet and host IP address.

 - Push the hardware data into database with _either_ of the following:
```
$ tink hardware push --file data.json
$ cat data.json | tink hardware push
```

 - If the data is valid, you must see a success message.

You can now follow the steps defined in the [Hello World!](/examples/hello-world) example to test if the setup is ready.
